                foundation in programming, machine learning, and microelectronics to create innovative solutions. I am adaptable and have 
                received multiple awards for my academic achievements. Additionally, I have taken on leadership roles and am actively 
                involved in various student organizations to develop both technical and interpersonal skills. I am committed to staying ahead 
                in the rapidly evolving tech landscape by pursuing certifications and keeping up with emerging trends to deliver impactful, 
                future-ready solutions.
