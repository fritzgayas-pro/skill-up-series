#Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another, either implicitly (automatic) or explicitly (manually by the programmer).

# I. Take Input from User - Age, Add 7 to the age and print it
age = input("Please enter your age: ")
age = int(age)+ 5
print(age)

# II. Take integer to String
print("Your age is "+ str(age))
