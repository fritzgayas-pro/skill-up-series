Expense Tracker - Summary

This project is a simple Expense Tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to:
- Add income/expense entries with description, category, and amount
- View total expenses dynamically
- See a list of all expenses
- Persist data using localStorage (data remains after reload)
- Visualize spending with a simple bar chart drawn using Canvas API

5. Canvas API:
   - Drawing a simple bar chart with rectangles and labels based on data values.
6. State Management:
