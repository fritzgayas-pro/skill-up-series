Todo App - Summary

This project is a simple Todo application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to:
- Add tasks with categories (Work, Study, Personal, Other)
- Mark tasks as done or undo them
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by category
- Persist tasks using localStorage (data remains after page reload)

JavaScript Concepts Learned:
1. DOM Manipulation:
   - Creating, updating, and deleting elements dynamically (document.createElement, appendChild, innerHTML).
2. Event Handling:
   - Handling button clicks and select input changes using onclick and onchange events.
3. State Management:
   - Using arrays of objects to represent tasks with id, text, category, and done status.
4. Local Storage:
   - Saving and retrieving JSON data with localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem().
   - Defensive parsing with JSON.parse and error handling.
5. Conditional Rendering:
   - Filtering tasks based on selected category.
   - Applying conditional styles for completed tasks.
6. Best Practices:
   - Input validation (preventing empty tasks).
   - Clean UI with CSS styling and separate styles for delete button.
