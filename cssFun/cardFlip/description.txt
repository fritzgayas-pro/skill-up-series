Build a Card Flip
Link: https://youtu.be/TzuWIHGFKCQ?si=3BDn6CTJndB2w5-z

- Card has two sides, and flips from front to back on hover
- Match styles as closely as you can 
- CSS only
- Don't worry about responsiveness
- Hints:
> A card flip is essentially an element rotating 180 degrees in 3D space. Use .card-container class to create the flip effect, then show and hide the front and back content as the card flips
> Use the transition property for a smooth flip
> The CSS properties transform-style: preserve-3d and backface-visibility will help you along the way

✅ CSS Concepts Learned in this Project
1. transform-style: preserve-3d → Keeps child elements in 3D space so the flip looks real.
2. transition → Smoothly animates the rotation when hovering.
3. rotateY(180deg) → Rotates the element horizontally to create the flip effect.
4. backface-visibility → Prevents the back text from showing through the front.
5. display toggle on hover → Swaps visibility between .card-front and .card-back.
