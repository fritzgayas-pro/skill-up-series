Build a Toggle Switch
Link: https://youtu.be/TzuWIHGFKCQ?si=3BDn6CTJndB2w5-z

- On click, toggle switch moves from one side to another
- Cursor becomes a pointer
- Match styles
- No JavaScript
- Hint: 
> If you hide the checkbox, you'll still be able to style and toggle back and forth between input:checked and input:unchecked pseudo classes by clicking on the checkbox label
> Use a sibling selector to style the .toggle-switch class when the input is :checked or :unchecked

✅ CSS Concepts Learned in this Project
1. Hidden Inputs (display: none) → Lets us remove the checkbox visually, but keep it interactive through its label.
2. Sibling Selector (~) → Allows us to style the .toggle-switch when the input:checked state changes.
3. CSS Variables (--var) → Make the toggle dimensions, colors, and timings easy to update.
4. Flexbox (display: flex) → Centers the toggle switch neatly in the middle of the page.
5. Cursor Styling (cursor: pointer) → Improves UX by showing that the toggle is clickable.
