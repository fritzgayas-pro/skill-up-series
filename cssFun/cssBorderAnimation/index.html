                CSS unlocks powerful visual effects with just a few lines of code.
                By combining gradients, keyframes, and custom properties,
                you can create stunning animations that look modern and smooth.

                This project demonstrates how <strong>@property</strong> and 
                <strong>conic-gradient</strong> can be used together to animate borders 
                without JavaScript. The effect is lightweight, fully responsive, 
                and supported in most modern browsers.
