- Match styles
- Personalize - display 4 things you love
- Words should rotate in an infinite loop
- No JavaScript!
- Hints:
> You can define the steps of an animation in keyframes using percentages, with 0% being the beginning of the animation and 100% being the end of the animation!
> Think about how you can use a pseudo element's content property to swap words.

✅ CSS Concepts Learned in this Project
1. Pseudo-elements (::after) → Great for inserting decorative or dynamic content without polluting HTML.
2. CSS content property → Lets you insert text or symbols directly from CSS.
3. Keyframes (@keyframes) → Define how properties change over time (from 0% → 100%).
4. Animation Loop (infinite) → Ensures the words cycle forever.
5. Semantic HTML advantage → Keeps <h1>I love</h1> simple, while CSS controls the rotating word.
