✅ CSS Concepts Learned in this Mini Project
1. Flexbox for Centering → The simplest, modern way to center elements both horizontally and vertically.
2. Nesting Divs → Creates a natural “target” effect without absolute positioning.
3. CSS Variables → Clean, reusable, and easy-to-maintain color system.
4. Border-Radius: 50% → Core trick to turn any square into a circle.
5. Viewport Height (vh) → Helps fill the page and center objects relative to the entire screen.
