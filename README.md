# Skill-Up Series
_From fundamentals to full-stack â€” one step at a time._

Welcome to the **Skill-Up Series** repository. This is a curated collection of files I've built while upskilling in the tech industry.

This repository brings together resources from tutorials, documentation, and my own insights with added comments and annotations to make the learning process clearer and more practical.

Whether you're just starting out or brushing up your knowledge, this series is designed to guide you how and why different elements, attributes, and many more are utilized.

Iâ€™ll be updating this repository regularly with new topics and projects, so stay tuned! ðŸŒŸ
