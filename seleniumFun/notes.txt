[STEPS]
Test automation script
- Launches a browser (Firefox) using Selenium.
- Opens a web page (htmlFun/index.html).
- Interacts with elements:
> Enters text into textboxes.
> Selects from a dropdown menu.
> Clicks a radio button and a checkbox.
> Submits the form using either GET or POST.
- Simulates what a real user would do in the browser.

[WHY DO IT?]
- Automates Repetitive Tests
- Cross-Browser Testing
- Regression Testing

Without Selenium: QA manually tests the website by clicking, typing, and submitting forms again and again → slow and error-prone.
With Selenium: QA writes scripts once, and the browser tests itself → fast, consistent, repeatable.
**Selenium is an open-source automation tool used for testing web applications.
